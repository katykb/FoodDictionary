  <h5>Why you need the Food Dictionary</h5>
  <p>
    Many food and diet applications allow you to search a food or branded food item easily. However, once you have 
    the nutrition info you need, it seems to become burried in the app. With Food Dictionary, the nutrition is 
    always easy to find on your screen. Every search you make will be logged by date to the My Foods section. 
    This allows you to see what foods you have searched with all their nutrition info. Quick and easy.
    <br>
    <br>
    Along with every food search made, a few recipe ideas will be given as well. Discover some new ways to prepare
    some of your favorite foods. Save the recipes you would like to see again to the My Recipes tab.
